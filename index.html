'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind
I'm already cursed

She's a fairy-tale, yeah
Even though it hurts
'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind
I'm already cursed
Years ago, when I was younger
I kinda liked a girl I knew
She was mine and we were sweethearts
That was then, but then it's true

I'm in love with a fairy tale
Even though it hurts
'Cause I don't care if I lose my mind
I'm already cursed

Every day, we started fighting
Every night, we fell in love
No one else could make me sadder
But no one else could lift me high above

I don't know what I was doing
When suddenly, we fell apart
Nowadays, I cannot find her
But when I do, we'll get a brand-new start

I'm in love with a fairy tale
Even though it hurts
